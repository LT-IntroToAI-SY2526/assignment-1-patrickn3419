# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
    When I first started to code in python, I thought that it was very much like Javascript, which I learned in Web Development during my freshmen year. I really like how in Python, indenting is used to indicate how different lines relate to eachother. All of the elements we learned so far were really easy to understand.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
    The AI was really good at breaking down chunks of code and giving me intel on how to code different functions and use different elements. For example, when I forgot how to use the -> arrow in functions, I asked the AI, "I am a beginner at learning Python. How can I specify what data types I am using in functions with the -> arrow?" I learned the formatting for the function, and I learned that clarifying what data types I was using helped the code run faster. Another example is when I did not know how to use a while loop. I asked the AI, "Can you explain how a while loop in python works? I am new to loops." I learned how to use a while loop and was able to incorporate it into the question I was working on.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
    The most challenging concept was looping through a list to find the max number, because I did not know where to start. However, by asking AI, I was able to get a hint towards the logic that I should be using behind the function. From there, I understood what I had to do when writing the function. It was more simple that I though; I just had to loop through the list and update a variable everytime python found a bigger number.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
    I learned that although AI can be useful for solving coding problems, it is often hard to get it to do exactly what you want. However, by asking it to explain concepts and give hints pointing towards the right solution, I could learn much better than just studying the solution alone. I also learned how being more specific in prompting allowed better responses that were more suited for my needs.
